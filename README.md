Background image from 500px.com and related spotify song playing.

## TODO
* create settings screen to setup 'themes' while we don't have the image recognition working.

## Dependencies

* Spotify app is required.
* 500px.com API key is required.
* npm (not extremely necessary if you make the changes... just using angular so far...)
